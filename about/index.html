      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p>RUSH is a video project launched in October 2023 by a group of multidisciplinary creatives in Berlin to promote
        electronic music. The aim of the project is to film DJ sets from mostly underrepresented artists in Berlin and
        beyond with a focus on FLINTA* and BIPoC folks.</p>
      <br />
      <p>We have sessions every first Thursday of the month at the collective-run Caf√© Kukumu in Moabit, Berlin. The
        sessions are open to everyone who wants to come and hang out with us.</p>
      <br />
      <p>We care about building a community and
        giving visibility and access to underrepresented artists, creating a safe space for artistic expression,
        networking and enjoyment around our biggest passion. Our values are grounded in inclusivity, respect,
        non-discrimination, harmony, solidarity and fellowship.</p>
